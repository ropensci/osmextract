\arguments{
\item{place}{Description of the geographical area that should be matched with
a \code{.osm.pbf} file. Can be either a length-1 character vector, an
\code{sf}/\code{sfc}/\code{bbox} object with any CRS, or a numeric vector of coordinates
with length 2. In the last case, it is assumed that the EPSG code is 4326
specified as c(LON, LAT), while you can use any CRS with \code{sf}/\code{sfc}/\code{bbox}
objects. See Details and Examples in \code{\link[=oe_match]{oe_match()}}.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to other methods}

\item{provider}{Which provider should be used to download the data? Available
providers can be browsed with \code{\link[=oe_providers]{oe_providers()}}. For \code{\link[=oe_get]{oe_get()}} and
\code{\link[=oe_match]{oe_match()}}, if \code{place} is equal to \verb{ITS Leeds}, then \code{provider} is
internally set equal to \code{"test"}. This is just for simple examples and
internal tests.}

\item{level}{An integer representing the desired hierarchical level in case
of spatial matching. For the \code{geofabrik} provider, for example, \code{1}
corresponds with continent-level datasets, \code{2} for countries, \code{3}
corresponds to regions and \code{4} to subregions. Hence, we could approximately
say that smaller administrative units correspond to bigger levels. If
\code{NULL}, the default, the \verb{oe_*} functions will select the highest available
level. See Details and Examples in \code{\link[=oe_match]{oe_match()}}.}

\item{version}{The version of the OSM extract to download. The default is
"latest". Other possible values are typically specified using the format
YYMMDD (e.g. "200101"). The complete list of all available historic files
for a given extract can be browsed from the Geofabrik website (e.g.
\url{https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/italy.html} and then click on 'raw
directory index').}

\item{quiet}{Boolean. If \code{FALSE}, the function prints informative messages.
Starting from \code{sf} version
\href{https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/news/index.html#version-0-9-6-2020-09-13}{0.9.6},
if \code{quiet} is equal to \code{FALSE}, then vectortranslate operations will
display a progress bar.}

\item{match_by}{Which column of the provider's database should be used for
matching the input \code{place} with a \code{.osm.pbf} file? The default is \code{"name"}.
Check Details and Examples in \code{\link[=oe_match]{oe_match()}} to understand how this parameter
works. Ignored when \code{place} is not a character vector since, in that case,
the matching is performed through a spatial operation.}

\item{max_string_dist}{Numerical value greater or equal than 0. What is the
maximum distance in fuzzy matching (i.e. Approximate String Distance, see
\code{\link[=adist]{adist()}}) between input \code{place} and \code{match_by} column that can be
tolerated before testing alternative providers or looking for geographical
matching with Nominatim API? This parameter is set equal to 0 if \code{match_by}
is equal to \code{iso3166_1_alpha2} or \code{iso3166_2}. Check Details and Examples
in \code{\link[=oe_match]{oe_match()}} to understand why this parameter is important. Ignored when
\code{place} is not a character vector since, in that case, the matching is
performed through a spatial operation.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, named \code{url} and \code{file_size}. The first
element is the URL of the \code{.osm.pbf} file associated with the input
\code{place}, while the second element is the size of the file in bytes (which
may be \code{NULL} or \code{NA})
}
\description{
This function is used to match an input \code{place} with the URL of a \code{.osm.pbf}
file (and its file-size, if present). The URLs are stored in several
provider's databases. See \code{\link[=oe_providers]{oe_providers()}} and examples.
}
\details{
If the input place is specified as a spatial object (either \code{sf} or \code{sfc}),
then the function will return a geographical area that completely contains
the object (or an error). The argument \code{level} (which must be specified as an
integer between 1 and 4, extreme values included) is used to select between
multiple geographically nested areas. We could roughly say that smaller
administrative units correspond to higher levels. Check the help page of the
chosen provider for more details on \code{level} field. By default, \code{level = NULL}, which means that \code{oe_match()} will return the area corresponding to
the highest available level. If there is no geographical area at the desired
level, then the function will return an error. If there are multiple areas at
the same \code{level} intersecting the input place, then the function will return
the area whose centroid is closest to the input place.

If the input place is specified as a character vector and there are multiple
plausible matches between the input place and the \code{match_by} column, then the
function will return a warning and it will select the first match. See
Examples. On the other hand, if the approximate string distance between the
input \code{place} and the best match in \code{match_by} column is greater than
\code{max_string_dist}, then the function will look for exact matches (i.e.
\code{max_string_dist = 0}) in the other supported providers. If it finds an exact
match, then it will return the corresponding URL. Otherwise, if \code{match_by} is
equal to \code{"name"}, then it will try to geolocate the input \code{place} using the
\href{https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/}{Nominatim API},
and then it will perform a spatial matching operation (see Examples and
introductory vignette), while, if \code{match_by != "name"}, then it will return
an error.

The fields \code{iso3166_1_alpha2} and \code{iso3166_2} are used by Geofabrik provider
to perform matching operations using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2}{ISO 3166-1 alpha-2} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2}{ISO 3166-2} codes. See
\link{geofabrik_zones} for more details.

\examples{
# The simplest example:
oe_match("Italy")

# The default provider is "geofabrik", but we can change that:
oe_match("Leeds", provider = "bbbike")

# By default, the matching operations are performed through the column
# "name" in the provider's database but this can be a problem. Hence,
# you can perform the matching operations using other columns:
oe_match("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
# Run oe_providers() for reading a short description of all providers and
# check the help pages of the corresponding databases to learn which fields
# are present.

# You can always increase the max_string_dist argument, but it can be
# dangerous:
oe_match("London", max_string_dist = 3, quiet = FALSE)

# Match the input zone using an sfc object:
milan_duomo = sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(1514924, 5034552)), crs = 3003)
oe_match(milan_duomo, quiet = FALSE)
leeds = sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(430147.8, 433551.5)), crs = 27700)
oe_match(leeds, provider = "bbbike")

# If you specify more than one sfg object, then oe_match will select the OSM
# extract that covers all areas
milan_leeds = sf::st_sfc(
  sf::st_point(c(9.190544, 45.46416)), # Milan
  sf::st_point(c(-1.543789, 53.7974)), # Leeds
  crs = 4326
)
oe_match(milan_leeds)

# Match the input zone using a numeric vector of coordinates
# (in which case crs = 4326 is assumed)
oe_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650)) # Milan, Duomo using CRS = 4326

# The following returns a warning since Berin is matched both
# with Benin and Berlin
oe_match("Berin", quiet = FALSE)

# If the input place does not match any zone in the chosen provider, then the
# function will test the other providers:
oe_match("Leeds")

# If the input place cannot be exactly matched with any zone in any provider,
# then the function will try to geolocate the input and then it will perform a
# spatial match:
\dontrun{
oe_match("Milan")}

# The level parameter can be used to select smaller or bigger geographical
# areas during spatial matching
yak = c(-120.51084, 46.60156)
\dontrun{
oe_match(yak, level = 3) # error
oe_match(yak, level = 2) # by default, level is equal to the maximum value
oe_match(yak, level = 1)}
